So filtering allows us to remove extraneous. Zooming is a kind of filter where
remove extraneous data based on the plotted coordinates of the data. When we select a zoom window, we chose to focus on some of the data
based on its displayed coordinates and to eliminate data outside of a window
based on its displayed coordinates. That's a kind of filter based on displayed
coordinates, but a filter can be applied to other attributes of the data
besides the displayed coordinates. And so in this case,
we've got our plot of all the countries of based on population and
life expectancy. We can filter out all the countries
that are in other continents and focus just on the countries
that are in say, Africa. And so by filtering on Africa,
we only plot the countries in Africa and the data is spread out nicely and
there's much less data here. So we've got room to be able to plot
the names of the individual countries and you can start to see the subset of the
larger dataset that corresponds to Africa. And you realize that many of
the countries that have low life expectancy are in Africa,
but also there's a separate band of countries in Africa that
have higher life expectancies. And by plotting the names, you've now
got room to see more of the details, because of this filter. You can see that those countries are
the ones located in Northern Africa and there's different ways of selecting
data by applying filters. If you have ordinal or nominal data,
for example, continent. Then you can click a check box, you can
show all of the different categories and select the ones that you want to look
at and the ones that you don't want to be plotted or
if you want to look at quantitative data. For example, if we want to look at
countries based on gross domestic product or other quantitative fields,
then we can set a range with a minimum and a maximum value and filter out
data above or below these extremal values in order to focus on certain
subsets of a quantitative range. So in tableau, it's quite easy to
filter data based on attributes, you would just drag the attribute
into this filter box. And so in this case,
if we have our countries displayed here differentiated by putting
the country in the marks box, we may want to filter
the countries based on continent. And so, I dragged the Region
dimension into the filter box and that will filter based on regions. And so now since region,
these continents are basically a category, they're presented to me in check boxes. And so if I want to only look
at a subset of the country say, Africa, I can just click Africa and
then click OK. And now I'm only looking at the countries
associated with Africa, the countries on the continent of Africa and you can
see there's a big differentiation here between these countries Entries t
the top and the countries at the bottom. And in fact, we can zoom in a little
bit further to give us more screen resolution to take a look at them. And then if we want to know what those
countries are, then I can drag country into the label box here and we can get
labels for each one of these countries. And you can see that the countries
in Northern Africa tend to have a higher life expectancy than
the countries in the rest of Africa. We don't want to overwhelm a display of
a lot of information with further details, especially when those
details are extraneous and distract us from general trends that
we should be seeing in the data and a very common way of doing
this is with a tool tip. If your mouse is sitting over a data item,
then a little pop-up window will come up and
give you the detail based on that data. And maybe some items that,
like you can select only that item or you can exclude that item and look at
other operations based on that item. A second way of finding details
on demand is a field selection. You can select a field of your dataset and you can find the data points
that field corresponds to or a certain setting of that field
corresponds to that get highlighted. And so there's all sorts of interactive
details that you can make available to a user. You just want to make them available
only when they're requested and not all at once, so
as to not overwhelm the viewer. So those are the basic steps for
setting up a good information visualization system to
understand abstract information. That first step, you want to set up
an overview to see all the data. The second step is you want to be
able to drill down to the details of that data by focusing, zooming, filtering. And then that third step, you want to be
able to provide details on your data, but only when they're requested. Only details on demand. [MUSIC]
