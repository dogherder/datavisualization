[MUSIC] So as we use our data visualization
tools to visualize databases, to visualize data cubes,
these data cubes are data hypercubes. They're going to be high-dimensional
databases with lots of dimensions. Our challenge is going to be getting
that information presented on a two-dimensional screen. And as we've seen before,
we can use worlds within worlds. In this case, we're visualizing
a four-dimensional hypercube of our World Bank indicator data. We're looking at life expectancy
versus infant mortality, but we're also looking at that over different
regions and also over different years. And so we have this worlds within worlds. We're looking at a four-dimensional
hypercube where we're plotting a table of region versus year, and
each element in that table is, itself, a two-dimensional plot of life
expectancy versus infant mortality. So this gives us a four-dimensional view
that we can expand from just that worlds within worlds idea to the general idea
of the organization of these axes. And each of these axes is representing
different dimensions of our data. And the relationship of the dimensions
of our data is organized quite well in OLAP databases as
the relationship between keys. So these database visualization systems have special tools designed
to help organize axes, especially since those axes are often
used to display multiple dimensions or represent different aggregations or
projections of multiple dimensions in order to reduce the dimensionality
of a large hypercube. And these are rows from
a paper on Polaris. Polaris is an early prototype system
that was a precursor to Tableau. So one of the things you can do
with axes is concatenate them. You can take two dimensions and place one dimension after the other in
order to display that on a single axis. And it provides, basically,
multiple views of the data. For example,
here's our sales data plotted by quarter. And so you can see that the sales were
low in the first two quarters and then they increased in
the second two quarters. And so
we can concatenate the time dimension with the product dimension into a single
axis that has time followed by product. And so we're getting two views of the same
data, but in the first half of the axis we're seeing the data plotted over time,
separated by quarter. And in the second half of the axis
we're seeing the same data plotted but separated by product. And so we can see that this
general trend of sales over time is being followed by the three
different products, but it's more accentuated with one of the products
than it is perhaps with the other two. And so that makes sense to concatenate a time
axis with a product axis in this case. It may not make sense to
concatenate a quarter axis with a month axis because they're
both time dimensions, and so you'd be seeing the same plot here
over the demarcations of quarter and then the same plot over
the demarcations of a month. And you'd be using half of
the space to build this up, and so it doesn't make as
much sense in that case. We can also take two dimensions and create an axis from the product
of those two dimensions. For example, if we have the data
over time, over four quarters. And we have the data over products
instead of showing them side-by-side, we might show the data for the coffee,
espresso and tea, the product values for quarter one, quarter two,
quarter three, quarter four. And so this product basically gives
you every combination of coffee and quarter so that you can see how your
data's performing over time and product simultaneously, with a single
axis here representing these two dimensions by looking at
all the combinations. Similarly, we could look
at quarter times month. This doesn't make much sense either,
because we'd be looking at the first quarter, which should represent
just the first three months and yet I'm plotting all 12 months here. And so just doing a simple product
of two time axes doesn't really help, because I'd only have data for
the first quarter showing up in the first three months, and then
the other nine months would basically be zero valued because there wouldn't
be data for these months. That was also in the first quarter. What makes sense for this case is
to do something called nesting, and nesting is a way of
limiting the combinations to the combinations that
are available in the database. And so in quarter one maybe we
didn't have any sales of tea. In quarter three maybe we didn't
have any sales of espresso. And so by doing this nesting operation,
it's basically similar to a product except we're not looking
at every possible combination. We're only showing on the axes
the combinations that actually exist in the database. And so now, if we have the month
nested inside quarter, if you have quarter as the major axis. And then the minor axis is the month. We're not seeing January, February, March,
April, May, June all in quarter one. We're only seeing the months in
quarter one where we have actual data values in the database. And since January, February,
March are the three months in quarter one, we'll have data values there, but
we wouldn't for April, May and June. We won't have any data values for April,
May and June in quarter one because April, May and June are in quarter two. And so that nicely nests
this higher resolution time axis into this coarser resolution
time axis, into a single axis. So Tableau has some functionality
that helps organize axes nicely. If we take our life expectancy data and
display that, we get an average over all
time over all the countries. And so we can start to
disaggregate this data by country. And what we will get is an alphabetized
list of all the countries. If we want to organize this better,
we can organize it by the continents. And now we get continents on the top and then all the countries
alphabetized by the continents. And then we can insert a subregion in
here that further refines the data by subregion. So you get this nice organization that
Tableau can automatically discover based on the data that's in there
because the data's in there by country, by region and by subregion. And it can detect how that data should be organized hierarchically in the axis
by each one of these sections. So it's by region, then subregion,
then country and region, and so we've got Africa and
Eastern Africa, and then we have all the countries
alphabetically in Eastern Africa. We can further subdivide this axis. For example,
if we want to disaggregate by the year, each one of these bars represents
the average over a year. If we want to drill down into how
the performance is over each year, I can add for each country
the performance over each year. And now for each country,
I've got the performance per year. And this might look better
actually as a line graph so that we can see how each country's
improving its performance in life expectancy over the 11 years
that we've recorded it here. You can also move the year in between,
and so now we're seeing the performance
on a per region basis. This is how each of the countries in
a given region are performing over a year. And then finally,
you can move year all the way out and now we're seeing for each year
the different breakdown in the countries. And so you can set up these hierarchical
axes and get worlds within worlds. You could even put it on the vertical axis
and you can get a higher dimensional view of your data by basically implementing
a worlds within worlds visualization. Where you have a table of plots and each cell of a two-dimensional data
is itself a two-dimensional plot, or two-dimensional table, or in this case,
a two-dimensional bar chart. So we can see how information
visualization systems specifically designed for visualizing databases, specifically OLAP data cube
style databases, can provide a database user with visualization
tools to gain insight into the data. [MUSIC]
